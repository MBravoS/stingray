+ check if files exist
+ harmonize screen output
+ change parameter names to make them more consistent (i.e. _min vs min)
+ parameter input checks

- document
- s3sax module
- multi-threading
- add lots of standard conversions (e.g. HI line properties, radio continuum, k-corrections)
- chat to Aaron about SEDs
- keep clusters together
- think about where/how to interpolate galaxy properties
- readme file
- lots of checks in R
- check/improve cosmology model


Claudia:
+ include L in hdf5, currently computed from effective volumes
+ some positions are just above 210 (assume these are groups or trees that have moved out)
+ many positions -1
+ add units in dataset headers
+ track galaxy axes
